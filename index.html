        <p>I am a military veteran working towards getting a degree in the MMP field through BMCC. I want to eventually get into iOS development through learning the applicable programming languages. I enjoy figuring out how things work which can vary from computers to mechanics. I am working on a personal training certification as well, and believe web development can help further my career there by not having to outsource.
